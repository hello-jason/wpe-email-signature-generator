*Note:* some email programs (like Nylas N1) have issues when pasting HTML. Use the raw HTML tab to grab the source code directly.

## Known Issues

1. Type into any optional field (phone numbers, twitter), then erase your text. The raw HTML for that thing in the generated output is still there, just hidden.
